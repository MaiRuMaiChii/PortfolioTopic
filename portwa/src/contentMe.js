I am 22 years old.Now I'm studying bachelor's in Electronic Computer Technology at King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok. I am a peaceful person who loves nature and adores pets. In my free time, I enjoy playing with my pets and playing the guitar. I love singing and listening to music. I can sit and listen to songs all day when I'm at home. But if I get the chance to go out, I prefer places surrounded by nature, with lots of trees and greenery. Just being in that kind of environment makes me happy.",
